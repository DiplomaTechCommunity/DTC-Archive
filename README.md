## How to Add Your Project to the Repository

To contribute your project, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the `src > components` folder and locate `ProjectData.js`.

2. Inside `ProjectData.js`, you'll find a set of key-value pairs representing project information.

```js
{
    "id": "<add your project's unique identifier>",
    "type": "<select a project type, e.g., Full stack, Backend, Web>",
    "project_name": "<enter your project's name>",
    "tech_stack": [
       "<list the technologies and frameworks used, e.g., 'React', 'HTML'>"
    ],
    "description": "<provide a concise and descriptive 1-2 line overview>",
    "author": "<mention the team members' names and surname initials>",
    "link": "<insert the link to your well-maintained GitHub repository>",
    "imgsrc": "<use a URL shortener for the project image/preview link>",
    "year": "<mention the year the project was created>",
    "majorProject" : "<true || false>"
},
```

Make sure to fill in the corresponding details accurately for your project as this will help maintain consistency and organization within the repository.
